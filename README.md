# CPU-Scheduling-Simulator

Implemented a C console application meant to benchmark 3 preemtive and
3 non-preemtive CPU scheduling algorithms, such as Round Robin, First Come First Served, Shortest Job First

The simulator uses random values for each process and displays a Gantt Chart for
the chosen algorithm and number of jobs
